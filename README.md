# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction


This project aims to analyze an individual's heart attack risk based on a trained model using various attributes of individuals. The model was trained using a dataset consisting of more than 8000 entries. We employed a Decision Tree algorithm for the training process and built the web interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an individual having a heart attack based on their attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol level, and other health indicators. By leveraging machine learning, specifically a Decision Tree model, we aim to provide accurate risk assessments to help with early detection and prevention.

## Features

- **Predict Heart Attack Risk**: Users can input their health data to get an assessment of their heart attack risk.
- **Visualization**: The web application displays the decision path of the Decision Tree model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML and CSS to ensure an easy-to-use and visually appealing interface.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The Flask backend processes user inputs in real-time to provide immediate feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree (SkitLearn)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Design**: Figma


## Usage
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Input your health data into the provided form.
Submit the form to receive your heart attack risk assessment.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of over 8000 entries, each with various attributes related to health indicators. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints but can be provided upon request.

## Development Process
Data Processing: Implemented exploratory and targeted data processing, data modeling, and data cleaning techniques to support the development of heart attack analysis with visualization techniques and distribution analysis.
Data Analysis: Applied data mining techniques (DecisionTree) to explore and analyze the dataset for insights with a train-test split of 70/30.
Database Design: Utilized NoSQL (MongoDB) to design a database to collect data, perform queries, and apply data sharing.
